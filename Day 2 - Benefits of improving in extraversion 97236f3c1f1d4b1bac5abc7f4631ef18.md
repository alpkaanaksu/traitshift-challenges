# Day 2 - Benefits of improving in extraversion

We´ve got another exciting piece of scientific insight for you today! Don’t worry, it’s not all going to be dry theory through out this challenge. 

Extraversion is one of the [Big Five personality traits](https://psychology.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), a commonly used set of traits in psychology for describing individual differences in personality. These personality traits are important predictors for various life outcomes.

Here are some of the positive life outcomes linked to extraversion that psychological research has found:

### Key Benefits of Extraversion: Positive Life Outcomes

1. **Greater Social Networks and Support**:
    - Extraverts often have larger and more diverse social networks, providing greater social support. This support can lead to better mental health and increased resilience against stress (Segrin & Taylor, 2007).
2. **Higher Levels of Happiness and Life Satisfaction**:
    - Extraverts generally report higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction. Their sociable nature allows them to engage in more rewarding social interactions, boosting their overall mood and sense of well-being (Lucas et al., 2008).
3. **Enhanced Career Success**:
    - Extraverts are often more successful in their careers due to their strong interpersonal skills, ability to network, and proactive approach to seeking opportunities. They tend to excel in leadership roles and positions that require extensive social interaction (Judge & Bono, 2001).
4. **Improved Physical Health**:
    - Extraverts may experience better physical health due to their active social lives. Regular social interaction has been linked to lower risks of chronic illnesses, better immune function, and increased longevity (Smith & MacKenzie, 2006).
5. **Effective Coping Mechanisms**:
    - Extraverts often employ more effective coping strategies when dealing with stress. Their tendency to seek social support and engage in positive activities helps them manage stress better than introverts (Penley & Tomaka, 2002).
