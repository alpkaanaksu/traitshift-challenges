# Day 9 - Noticing Progress

Hey!

For today, itâ€™s time to look at the big picture. To notice how far you have already come. To feel how
much you have already achieved - in only 9 days!

Please get your notebook / notes app and make a list with at least 5 situations (ideally all of them)
where you were sociable. This could be situations that just happened or those that you directly
initiated, like on Day 4. Try to remember how they felt and if they had any common themes.

If you can come up with less than 5 challenges, thatâ€™s totally fine! Look back to the social minichallenge from Day 4 and please do it again.

For tomorrow make a plan to say hello to a complete stranger and make a comment on shared
surroundings (â€žthe weather is niceâ€œ, â€žThis piece of clothing really suits you! Where did you get it?â€œ).
In your plan, answer the following questions:

- When?
- Where
- What obstacles might be in your way?
- How will you overcome these obstacles?

Amazing job sticking with the program so far! See you soon! ðŸ’š
