# Day 8 - Social Skills

Please watch this YouTube video: [How to Be More Social](https://youtu.be/7fnVcXfPe5c?si=o34xNVuNVgWXMg36). This video showcases three effective techniques to enhance your social skills in conversations.

### Steps:

1. **Watch the Video**: As you watch, jot down the three techniques mentioned that can help improve your social skills.
2. **Reflect on Each Technique**: After noting down the techniques, take a few minutes to reflect on each one. Think about how you might apply these techniques in your own interactions.
3. **Identify Areas for Improvement**: Determine which areas you think you could improve the most. Consider specific situations where you could practice these techniques.
4. **Put It into Practice**: Remember yesterdays homework? ;) Have a conversation with a friend you havenâ€™t spoken to in a long time. If none of your friends are available, make a phone call to a business youâ€™ve looked up before and ask them a question about what they are selling or whatâ€™s in stock.

Happy watching and practicing! ðŸ’š
