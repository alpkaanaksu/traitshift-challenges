# Day 10 - Expand your comfort zone

Today we are going into action again. Please remember your plan from yesterday, about saying a
hello to a stranger and commenting on your shared surroundings. Since you wrote down when and
were you will be able to accomplish this already, just do it!

Even if you feel a little bit of resistance at the start, remember how successful you already were in the last couple of days. You can do it!

After the experience, write down what went well and how you are feeling afterwards.
Tomorrow we will be doing something super fun: We are asking strangers to play rock paper scissors for 3 rounds.

Please write down a quick plan for how you will accomplish this task.
In your plan, answer the following questions:

- When?
- Where
- What obstacles might be in your way?
- How will you overcome these obstacles?

See you soon! ðŸ’š
