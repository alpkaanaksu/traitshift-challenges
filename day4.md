# Day 4 - Get active


Hey!

After learning so much in the past 3 days, itâ€™s time to practice! Remember your plan from yesterday? You picked one of these three mini-challenges and you already planned out when, where and how you will do it (if you havenâ€™t done this yet, no problem, you can still do this challenge ðŸ˜„). 

Letâ€™s do it! If you are still feeling unmotivated it can be useful to take out your notebook or notetaking app and write down the following statement:

Today, when [situation] happens, I will do [mini-challenge]. 

And then sign with your name.

You are doing really great so far, this is an important and exciting step in your journey toward becoming more outgoing ðŸ’š.

After accomplishing your challenge, please take a minute to write down your feelings in the situation. To really feel how easy talking to others becomes after some practice, letâ€™s make a plan do the same mini-challenge tomorrow.

Again, you get to pick out when, where and how you will do it!

See you tomorrow ðŸ’š
