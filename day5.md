# Day 5 - Gap Analysis

Today, let's build on your progress by repeating one of the actions you did yesterday. Are you noticing any changes or improvements?

For today's tasks, please take about 3-5 minutes for each activity:

1. On a scale from 1 to 10, rate your current level of sociability. Now, rate the level where you aspire to be. What steps can you take to bridge the gap between these two scores?
2. What would it take to move from a 4 to a 5 on your sociability scale?
3. How will you know when you have moved one step up on the scale? What specific behaviors or outcomes will indicate this improvement?

Try to come up with your own ideas first, as they will best suit your individual situation. If you need help, youâ€™ll find examples of indicators and corresponding measures below.

Keep up the great work and remember, small steps lead to big changes! ðŸ’š
